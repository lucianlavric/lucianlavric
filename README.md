## ğŸ˜Š About Me! 
Hey, I'm Luka ğŸ‘‹, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Western and a full-stack developer. I enjoy creating futuristic tech at hackathons and meeting fellow developers passionate about building cool projects!

<!-- ## ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m Currently Working On
I'm currently building out a couple of cool projects, including [Portal](https://wearportal.co) - a wearable AI tool that lets you rewind your memories! I also spend almost every other weekend destroying my sleep schedule at hackathons, so check out my [DevPost!](https://devpost.com/ian-korovinsky/). Finally, I'm also part of a few entrepreneurship incubators, such as Velocity and Eigenspace, where I love meeting cool people :) -->
